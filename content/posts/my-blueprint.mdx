We all have our unique ways of approaching work, and sometimes, understanding those differences can make all the difference in a successful collaboration. {{ className: 'lead' }}

I’ve found that creating a document like this not only helps to set expectations but also builds a foundation of trust and open communication. I can’t take all the credit for the idea, though. A former colleague, [Luc Levesque](https://luclevesque.com/blogs/luc-levesques-blog/leader-blueprint-how-to-help-new-employees-be-rockstars-a-new-approach) inspired me to build my own that I’ve used in my different roles throughout the years.

I figured I’d share in public, so, without further ado, here’s mine:

<section className="bg-[url('/flux.svg')] sm:p-20 p-10 rounded-3xl">
<h1 className="mt-0 font-bold text-astronaut-800 mb-4">Tim’s Blueprint</h1>

I studied Tae Kwon Do for about 10 years, and many times during classes, the instructors would demonstrate techniques in the most terrifying way possible: spin-kicking with all their might directly towards you and stopping within millimeters of making contact.

Any time a student would flinch, the instructor would remind us that:

> if you’re getting hit, it’s going to hurt whether your eyes are open or closed, so best to keep them open and react {{className: 'text-lg'}}

This blueprint serves as my attempt to share my working style and idiosyncrasies, so you know what to expect when we collaborate. If you enjoy personality tests, my _Meyers-Briggs_ type is [ENFP](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality), my _DiSC style_ is [high-I](https://discinsights.com/personality-style-i), and my top _Gallup StrengthsFinder_ strength is "[Ideation](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/249674/ideation-theme-productively-aim-your-cliftonstrengths-talent.aspx)."

## My values

### Clarity over comfort

Sometimes it can be hard to speak up, especially when the pressure is on or anxieties are high. _These are precisely the times to take a deep breath and push through the discomfort to make yourself heard._

For me, this means asking "dumb" questions, challenging assumptions I don't understand, admitting what I don't know, and seeking help when I need it.

### The truth shall set you free

This isn’t necessarily the same as “[radical candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/),” though I do appreciate giving and getting it.

I once had my discovery work described as an _“interrogation of the problem space,”_ and thought it fit with my approach to fact finding.

I strive to be thorough and thoughtful in my relationships, separating problems from people and being truthful about my intentions, feelings, and motivations.

### Hear every voice

I believe that the best solutions emerge from diverse perspectives, and that it requires intentional effort to ensure everyone's voice is heard.

I value having a voice at the table, giving others a voice, and making sure no one feels left out. This approach can help bring a team together in a shared space, though it may occasionally slow down the process.

Sometimes, this causes me to move slower than I’d like, so I
welcome any feedback if it seems like I’m leaning too far towards a perfect consensus.

## My quirks

### I think out loud a lot

At times, I can be quite verbose, especially if I'm anxious or if it seems like my message isn't resonating.

I've been working on this, but I appreciate a gentle reminder. Asking for a "10-second summary" is a great way to help me wrap up and take the conversation offline.

### I think best asynchronously and nonlinearly

I often have to do a “[breadth-first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)” inventory of a space to understand it, and this can be hard to do in a synchronous conversation.

I'm also prone to tangents when excited about a subject. If this makes it hard to follow my train of thought, please let me know. I'll do my best to summarize and reframe.

### I have big feelings

I wear my heart on my sleeve and believe that vulnerability is a key ingredient for open, effective, and meaningful relationships.

There's no hidden meaning or motive when I ask about (or share my own) feelings, and find that doing so leads to more trusting, open collaboration.

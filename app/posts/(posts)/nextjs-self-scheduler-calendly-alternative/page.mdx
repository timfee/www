# Build and host your own scheduling page using Next.js and Google APIs

For some weird reason, I‚Äôve been interested in a personal self-scheduling
solution (like Calendly, Cal.com), but one that's simple, free, and without
branding or bloat.

So, I made my own Calendly alternative, and wanted to share with the world and
walk through it.

The current solution is intentionally lightweight and opinionated, but hopefully
flexible enough should you want to extend it.

The site has the following bits of functionality:

1. **It displays a calendar of your available dates for meetings.** By default,
   I‚Äôve configured it to show 14 days of availability. This isn't your usual
   calendar; it's not designed for long-range bookings out of the box. It lists
   all dates inline without pagination by month, keeping things simple.
2. **It supports meetings by phone or Google Meet.** If Meet is selected,
   conference details will be added automatically.
3. **It allows you to review and approve requests** before they‚Äôre added to your
   As I mentioned, it's opinionated and designed for simple use cases for
   individuals in mind. üòÅ

Some technical notes:

- Uses Next.js 13 and Typescript with Tailwind.
- Has (some) testing on the more trickier functions.
- Uses minimal libraries. For instance, I built my own lightweight wrapper to
  hit Google APIs directly to avoid importing `googleapis`.
- Probably has some over-engineered bits that feel nice, like `lru-cache`
  limiting on API endpoints, a more intuitive timezone selection piece, and
  formatted emails.

# Getting started

## Clone the repo

Clone my [repository](https://github.com/timfee/meet.git) to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timfee/meet.git
```

Don't forget to `npm install`

## Set up Google API

You can skip this section if you already have (or know how to get) an Oauth
Client with scopes `https://mail.google.com/` and
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` and a redirect URI of
`https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/`

  title="Creating a new Oauth Project"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowFullScreen></iframe>

1. Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate and create a new
   project. Don't sweat the name, nobody will see it but you.
2. Once your project is created, head to **APIs & Services** ‚ñ∂
   **[Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)** and search for
   [Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
   and
   [Google Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com).
   Click Enable.
3. Then go to **APIs & Services** ‚ñ∂
   **[OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)**.
   If you have a Workspace account, choose **Internal**. If you're using a
   Gmail/personal account, you‚Äôll have to choose **External**.
4. Enter an App Name (you can just use `Meet Me` - nobody but you will see
   this). Choose a user support email from the dropdown (nobody but you will see
   it), and input your email address once more at the bottom under _Developer
   Contact Information_. Save and continue.
5. Don‚Äôt worry about entering anything on the next screen when it asks you for
   scopes, just click Save and Continue.
6. If you chose **External** in step 3, add your own account as a test user.
   Save and continue.
7. That should do it. Now head to **APIs & Services** ‚ñ∂
   **[Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)**. and
   click **Create Credentials**; pick **OAuth Client ID** from the list.
8. Pick **Web application** from "Application Type" and don't worry about the
   name.
9. Add `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/` to **Authorized Redirect
   URIs** (you'll see why in a bit).
10. Click **Create** and take a note of the Client ID and Client Secret. You'll
    need them.

What we just did was create an OAuth client, which will allow us to
programmatically access your calendar and email.

We're going to use Google's OAuth Playground as a way to store a refresh token
that will allow us to access your calendar and email indefinitely.

## Get your refresh token

You can skip this section if you‚Äôre able to obtain a `refresh_token` of your
own. If you have an OAuth Client ID already but need to get a refresh token,
you‚Äôll need to go to your existing credential and add
`https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/` as a redirect URL.

  title="Getting your refresh token"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowFullScreen></iframe>

1. Visit https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/
2. Press the gear on the right, and check the box to "Use your own OAuth
   credentials" -- paste your Client ID and Secret from Step 9.
3. Now scroll through the list on the left and click the triangle next to
   `Gmail API v1` and click `https://mail.google.com/` so it gets a check. Then
   scroll to `Google Calendar API v3` and click
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` to check it.
4. Click Authorize APIs.
5. Follow the prompts. If you made this an **External** project, you might get a
   scary looking screen saying Google hasn't reviewed your app yet. Don't worry
   about it; hit the Continue button (on the left!).
6. You'll be taken back to the screen you were just on with an **Authorization
   code** populated in the text box. Click the **Exchange authorization code for
   tokens** button.
7. When the screen changes to "Step 3", click on "Step 2" to take you back to
   the text box with your refresh token. Copy it.

At this point you should have your:

- OAuth Client ID
- OAuth Secret
- Refresh Token

You need to be **VERY** careful with these values. Don't commit them to Github
directly, or send them to anyone. This allows programmatic access to read and
write email and calendar events.

Because we're using `nodemailer` to send emails using `XOAUTH2`, we need the
entire Gmail scope. In a future version, I‚Äôll work to reduce the privileges
needed.

## Configure `.env.local`

Open up the code in your favorite editor, and open the .env.template.local file.

- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: Your Client ID from earlier
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRET`: Your Client Secret from earlier.
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REFRESH`: Your refresh token

I‚Äôve also chosen to store sensitive-ish values in this file, so fill your email
address (must match your Gmail address), your name, and your phone number (if
you want).

Rename this file to `.env.local`. If you‚Äôre using Vercel, make sure to upload
these to your environment variables.

I‚Äôve made sure that the `.gitignore` file in my repo ignores `.env.local` but
always give a double check to your commits to make sure you don‚Äôt accidentally
commit your secrets.

**If you accidentally share these secrets, you should:**

1. **Immediately revoke token access.** Visit
   https://myaccount.google.com/permissions and look for the name of your app.
   then click "Remove Access"

2. **Generate a new Web Client Secret.** Go to
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials and click click the pencil
   icon next to your Web Client. On the next screen, click "Add Secret" to add a
   new secret. Then trash the old one.

## Configure `./config.ts`

1. Set the allowed meeting durations by creating an array of integers
   representing the number of minutes for each duration. For example, to allow
   15, 30, and 60-minute meetings:

```ts
export const ALLOWED_DURATIONS = [15, 30, 60]\
```

2. Define the default meeting duration, which will be used if no other duration
   is specified. In this case, we set it to 30 minutes:

```ts
export const DEFAULT_DURATION = 30
```

3. Specify the calendar(s) to check for availability by creating an array of
   calendar identifiers. In this case, we only check the "primary" calendar,
   which is Google‚Äôs default:

```ts
export const CALENDARS_TO_CHECK = ["primary"]
```

4. Set the padding between available slots by specifying the number of minutes
   as SLOT_PADDING. In essence, this will show the specified number of minutes
   before and after each appointment in your calendar as "booked" so you‚Äôre not
   back-to-back. By default, it‚Äôs 0:

```ts
export const SLOT_PADDING = 0
```

5. Set your IANA timezone string that you work out of (or more specifically,
   that your availability, below, will be defined in). By default, it‚Äôs mine :)

```ts
export const OWNER_TIMEZONE = "America/Los_Angeles"
```

6. Specify the times you‚Äôd like to take meetings each week by setting
   `OWNER_AVAILABILITY`. The object accepts a day of the week as a key (0 =
   Sunday, 6 = Saturday), and for each key, accepts an array of intervals, which
   contain start and end times as hours.

To illustrate the point a little better, the default values are set up to allow
appointments from 9AM - 5PM, Monday-Friday, in the timezone if `OWNER_TIMEZONE`:

```ts
const DEFAULT_WORKDAY = [
  {
    start: {
      hour: 9,
    },
    end: {
      hour: 17,
    },
  },
]

export const OWNER_AVAILABILITY: AvailabilitySlotsMap = {
  1: DEFAULT_WORKDAY,
  2: DEFAULT_WORKDAY,
  3: DEFAULT_WORKDAY,
  4: DEFAULT_WORKDAY,
  5: DEFAULT_WORKDAY,
}
```

You can also tweak options for formatting local dates and times, but the
defaults should be fine and flexible enough.

Now, let's dig into the code!

# Key components

Before diving into the actual flow, let‚Äôs go over some of the basic building
blocks that do the heavy lifting:

## <code>lib/availability</code> functions

This is where the actual work of determining your availability takes place. The
main functions here are:

### getAccessToken.ts

This uses your refresh token to obtain an `access_token` that we can use for
`Bearer` authorization when communicating with Google‚Äôs APIs.

```ts
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  grant_type: "refresh_token",
  client_secret: process.env.GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRET,
  refresh_token: process.env.GOOGLE_OAUTH_REFRESH,
  client_id: process.env.GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID,
})

const response = await fetch("https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  },
  body: params.toString(),
  cache: "no-cache",
})
```

The response will include an access_token if successful, which we‚Äôd ideally
cache for use across all sessions (since it‚Äôs valid for 1 hour). However, I‚Äôm
assuming that my limited popularity means infrequent site visits won‚Äôt send too
many API requests.

I opted to write this myself instead of using `googleapis`, which is a much
heavier library.

### getPotentialTimes.ts

This function generates an array of DateTimeInterval objects representing
potential time slots available for booking.

```ts
function getPotentialTimes({
  start,
  end,
  duration,
  availabilitySlots,
}: {
  start: Day
  end: Day
  duration: number
  availabilitySlots: AvailabilitySlotsMap
}): DateTimeInterval[]
```

We use the `OWNER_AVAILABILITY` constant in `./config.ts` to define when you‚Äôd
theoretically accept appointments when you‚Äôre not busy and generate
`duration`-sized slots from the `start` Day to `end` Day.

### getBusyTimes.ts

We use the `freeBusy` service of Google Calendar to get intervals where you‚Äôre
busy. This doesn‚Äôt expose any information about the appointments themselves, so
it‚Äôs a handy way to get the times we need to block from being booked.

```ts
async function getBusyTimes({ start, end }: DateTimeInterval)
```

We pass it a starting `Date` and ending `Date`. We use the `CALENDARS_TO_CHECK`
array in `config.ts` to specify the calendars we should consider when blocking
time. (By default, we use `primary`.)

We‚Äôll get back a single array of intervals that will be removed from the
potential slots returned by `getPotentialTimes`.

### getAvailability.ts

This function reconciles the potential time slots with periods marked as busy.
If `padding` is specified, each busy period will be buffered by that number of
minutes, helping you avoid back-to-back meetings.

```tsx
export default function getAvailability({
  potential: potentialParam,
  busy,
  padding = SLOT_PADDING,
}: {
  potential?: DateTimeInterval[]
  busy?: DateTimeInterval[]
  padding?: number
}): DateTimeInterval[]
```

The end result is an array of slots that (a) fall within your daily schedule
configuration, and (b) aren‚Äôt booked.

### createAppointment.ts

When we‚Äôre ready to actually add the appointment that a user requests to your
calendar, this function handles it.

```ts
async function createCalendarAppointment(props: AppointmentProps)
```

This function constructs and executes an API request to Google Calendar that
invites the recipient and provides instructions based on whether the meeting is
a `phone` call or a Google `meet` meeting.

## Context

We‚Äôll use `useReducer()` to handle the application‚Äôs state, which consists of:

```ts
 StateType = {
  /** The earliest day we‚Äôll offer appointments */
  start: Day
  /** The latest day we‚Äôll offer appointments */
  end: Day
  /** The day the user selected (if made) */
  selectedDate?: Day
  /** The end user‚Äôs timezone string */
  timeZone: string
  /** The number of minutes being requested,
   *  must be one of the values in ALLOWED_DURATIONS
   */
  duration: number
  /** Whether the booking modal is open or busy. */
  modal: ModalStatus
  /** The time slot the user selected (if made). */
  selectedTime?: DateTimeInterval
}
```

In addition to your typical state functionality, this also handles a few pieces
of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù:

- When the state is updated, we push key parts of it to `searchParams`, (e.g.
  `?duration=XX&timeZone=YY&selectedDate=ZZ`).
- The initial state will use the browser‚Äôs resolved timezone if none is
  provided.
- The initial state leaves `selectedDate` undefined if it‚Äôs not passed,
  signaling to our page rendering code that we want to set the `selectedDate` to
  the first day with nonzero available slots.

# The main page (`pages/index.tsx`)

We use `getServerSideProps` to handle querying Google Calendar‚Äôs API.

**This is where the two weeks of availability is set,** you can change the
starting day or ending day to suit your needs. For example, you might not want
to accept same day appointments (add an offset of `1` to `start`), or may only
offer slots for one week (change the offset of `end` to `7`.)

**This also helps reconstitute the State from the query parameters.** We use
`zod` to do some basic validation for passed `duration`, `timeZone` and
`selectedDate`.

We pass these props to the page, along with the `busy` times returned from
Google.

```ts
export async function getServerSideProps({ query }: GetServerSidePropsContext) {
  // ....

  return {
    props: {
      start: start.toString(),
      end: end.toString(),
      busy: mapDatesToStrings(busy),
      duration,
      ...(timeZone && { timeZone }),
      ...(selectedDate && { selectedDate }),
    },
  }
}
```

We leave `timeZone` and `selectedDate` out of the response.

- We don‚Äôt want to use the server‚Äôs `timeZone`, since it might differ from the
  user‚Äôs.
- We don‚Äôt want to propose an initially `selectedDate` yet, either.

You‚Äôll notice that the default `Page` component is wrapped with our provider:

```ts
export default withProvider(Page)
```

This will allow us, in `AvailabilityContext.tsx`, to parse the params we resolve
into the State.

In our page‚Äôs render function, we use the `duration` and `timeZone` from the
state‚Äîas well as your configured `start` and `end` days‚Äîto build out the
calendar.

```tsx
const potential = getPotentialTimes({
  start: startDay,
  end: endDay,
  duration,
  availabilitySlots: OWNER_AVAILABILITY,
})

const offers = getAvailability({
  busy: mapStringsToDates(busy),
  potential,
})
```

This allows us to change the UI to adapt to different durations as the user
changes them in the session:

<Image
  src="/images/next-js-personal-calendaring/durations.png"
  width="993"
  height="577"
  alt="Changing durations before and after"
/>

# The availability components

In `./components/availability`, we have the main `AvailabilityPicker.tsx`
component, that brings together:

- user input controls for timezone and duration
- date selection controls
- time selection controls

The picker itself also takes the array of availability times returned from
`getAvailability` and turns them into a map, keyed by the date of the week.

This handles cases where timezone difference causes the end-user‚Äôs availability
offerings to be on a different day than your local timezone:

<Image
  src="/images/next-js-personal-calendaring/timezones.png"
  width="993"
  height="577"
  alt="Changing timezones before and after"
/>

While we‚Äôre creating this map, we also will keep track of the **maximum number
of available slots in any one day**, which allows us to show a visual
availability summary (more on that later.)

## Timezone and Duration input controls

We consume state and dispatch updates in these components directly.

- Duration is pretty straightforward.
- Timezone has a little bit of over-engineering üòâ.

To avoid showing end-users a huge list of IANA timezone strings, it uses
[`@vvo/tzdb`](https://github.com/vvo/tzdb) and only shows unique display
strings.

In cases where the passed timeZone isn‚Äôt the canonical timeZone for an area
(e.g. `America/Kentucky/Louisville` isn‚Äôt represented; but it‚Äôs the same as
`America/New_York`), we make sure the right timezone is shown as selected in the
dropdown.

## Calendar

This is my opinionated take on a calendar, with the assumption that you don‚Äôt
want to schedule months out in advance:

`Calendar.tsx` will generate days from `start` to `end`. It will show greyed out
and disabled days _before_ `start` and _after_ `end` so every row of weeks is
complete (starts Sunday, and ends Saturday).

This won‚Äôt work for every single international context, so you may need to tweak
it a bit if your weeks don‚Äôt start on Sunday and end on Saturday.

`DayButton.tsx` is used to render the dates and handles dispatching events to
update the `selectedDate` state and show times that correspond to the date
selected.

Additionally:

- The current date will be marked as **TODAY**
- Any date with no availability will be disabled
- Dates with availability will have 1 - 3 dots underneath that indicates how
  much availability the current day has relative to maximum availability across
  all days considered.
- Padded dates outside of the range will never get an availability dot.

# Times

This functionality is a little more straightforward; we simply iterate over the
times that are within the range of the selected date (in the requested
timezone).

`TimeButton.tsx` renders a button that will dispatch an update to `selectedSlot`
and open the booking modal.

# The booking form

`./components/booking/BookingForm.tsx` uses `Modal.tsx` to render itself,
presenting the user with a human-readable version of the time slot they selected
in their local timezone.

There‚Äôs an array of `locations` that will render as option buttons to let the
user choose how they‚Äôd like to meet. Right now, it‚Äôs just `meet` and `phone`.
More on how those are used later.

We do only simple client-side validation here to make sure the email address is
valid and name is provided.

We `POST` the result to `./pages/api/request` and redirect the user to
`./pages/confirmation.tsx` once we get a successful response.

## The `request` endpoint

`./pages/api/request` will take the `name`, `email`, `location`, `start`, `end`,
`duration` and `timeZone` and use it to construct an email to `OWNER_EMAIL` from
your `.env` file.

This email (which is rendered using `./lib/email/messages/Approval.ts`) will
give you the options to accept the meeting or decline the meeting.

Another email is sent to the user‚Äôs provided `email`, letting them know you‚Äôll
get back to them. This email is rendered using
`./lib/email/messages/Confirmation.ts`.

The URL to actually book the appointment gets constructed as
`/api/confirm?data={params}&key={hash}`, where `data` is the serialized
appointment information, and `key` is a `sha256` hash of the data, salted with
your `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRET`.

Also, I‚Äôve added some `lru-cache` rate limiting. You might want to tweak this
(or maybe add captcha protection, etc.) if you‚Äôre getting spam.

## The `confirm` endpoint

This confirms (accepts) the meeting.

It validates that the `data` and `hash` match, and then uses the
`createAppointment` helper function to issue the API request that will create
the appointment and notify the recipient.

This helper function handles conditionally rendering instructions that include
adding your `OWNER_PHONE_NUMBER` (from the `.env` file) as instructions for
`phone` requests, or instructing Google to add `meet` conference details if
requested.

Once you confirm the appointment, you‚Äôll be taken to
`./pages/booked?url={event_id}` which will let you click into the actual Google
Calendar permalink URL for the event that was just created.

# Wrapup

Phew! That was a lot. This was a fun little project. There‚Äôs definitely more
work to do, and I welcome any contributions!
